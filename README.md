This web application allows people to sign up for a site that hosts a collection
of events. Users must login to access the site's features. Once inside, a users 
profile page will display upcoming events he/she will be attending, past events 
he/she has attended, and all of his/her hosted events. 

Users can earn all-star status by hosting 5 or more events. This status is 
denoted on the users profile, and in the user's listing in the user index. 

A few integration tests have been written to ensure only admins can delete
users among other things. 

Feel free to use "foo@bar.com" (password: foobar) to log in and demo the app. 

The app can be accessed on heroku at this address:
