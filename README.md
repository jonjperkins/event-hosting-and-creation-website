This purpose of this project is to demonstrate many-to-many relationships
amongst Rails models, using foreign keys and class names to set up the 
correction associations. This site is modeled after Eventbrite. Users can signup,
login/logout, create/attend events, and edit/delete events. User and Event views
display what guests are attending each event, how many events a user has created,
separate tabs for upcoming and past events on the user/show and events/index pages,
and a few other outputs born from the fires of active record asssociations and 
relations! 

Feel free to use foo@bar.com (password: foobar) to log in and demo the app. 

The app can be accessed on heroku here: <a href="heroku.com/obscure-earth-39557.herokuapp.com"></a>
