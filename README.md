This web application allows people to sign up for a site that hosts a collection
of events. Users must login to access the site's features. Once inside, their 
profile page will display upcoming events they are attending, past events they 
have attended, and all of their hosted events. 

Users can earn all-star status by hosting 5 or more events. This status is 
denoted on their profile, and the user index. 

A few integration tests have been written to ensure only admins can delete
users among other things. 

Feel free to use "foo@bar.com" (password: foobar) to log in and demo the app. 

The app can be accessed on heroku at this address:
