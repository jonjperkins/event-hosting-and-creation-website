This web application allows people to sign up for a site that hosts a collection
of events. Users must login to access the site's features. Once inside, a users 
profile page will display upcoming events he/she will be attending, past events 
he/she has attended, and all of his/her hosted events. 

Tests are written in Minitest. Nearby events geolocated by Geocoder gem, and maps
provided through the Google maps API. Figaro gem used to hide API key.
